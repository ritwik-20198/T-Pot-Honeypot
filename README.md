# T-Pot-Honeypot

Executed an independent project involving the deployment, configuration, and implementation of a honeypot on multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud instances based in London (As per reports, the United Kingdom (UK) suffers more cyberattacks compared to any other European country), Israel region (Tel Aviv) amidst the heightened tension between Israel and Palestine, Korea region (constant conflict between North and South Korea) to gain insights into threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and malware behavior. 

Honeypots have been considered in such a way that they help the security analyst learn and understand various fields of cybersecurity. Email security (Mailoney), Mobile Security (ADBhoney), and Network Security (Citrix honeypot, Ddospot) have been analysed in this project. In order to allow traffic into our instance’s individual honeypot ports, ingress traffic rules/VPC firewall rules were customised.



All this traffic data is logged using Logstash (ELK stack) and visualized using Kibana dashboards. To analyse the data visualisation of the threat landscape, the Kibana Dashboard and Discover components of the ELK stack were utilised. Additionally, I utilized tools such as VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, MITRE Attack and Defend framework to swiftly generate comprehensive reports for efficient analysis.

Interpreted the TTPs used by threat actors in the case of observed ADBhoney-Mailoney attacks and mapped them to MITRE Attack and Defend framework provided actionable threat intelligence in the form of TTPs and security recommendations.
